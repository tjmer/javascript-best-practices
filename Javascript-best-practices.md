Declarations on top
Comment as much as needed but not more
Initialize Variables when they are declared
Declare objects with const
use === instead of == when comparing
Always read, books, blogs, code, etc.
Recognize and remove duplicate code
Place scripts at the bottom of your page
Use template literals
